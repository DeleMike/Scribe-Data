### Wikidata and Wikipedia language data extraction

**Scribe-Data** is a convenient command-line interface (CLI) for extracting and formatting language data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). Functionality includes allowing users to list, download, and manage language data directly from the terminal.

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [featured by](#featured-by) also being good resources for learning more about Scribe.

Scribe applications are available on [iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (WIP) and [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (planned).

Check out Scribe's [architecture diagrams](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the organization including our applications, services and processes. It depicts the projects that [Scribe](https://github.com/scribe-org) is developing as well as the relationships between them and the external systems with which they interact.

<a id="Process"></a>

# Process [`⇧`](#contents)

The CLI commands defined within [scribe_data/cli](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/blob/main/src/scribe_data/cli) and the notebooks within the various [scribe_data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/tree/main/src/scribe_data) directories are used to update all data for [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), with this functionality later being expanded to update [Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) and [Scribe-Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) once they're active.

The main data update process in triggers [language based SPARQL queries](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/tree/main/src/scribe_data/wikidata/language_data_extraction) to query language data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) using [SPARQLWrapper](https://github.com/RDFLib/sparqlwrapper) as a URI. The autosuggestion process derives popular words from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) as well as those words that normally follow them for an effective baseline feature until natural language processing methods are employed. Functions to generate autosuggestions are ran in [gen_autosuggestions.ipynb](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/blob/main/src/scribe_data/wikipedia/gen_autosuggestions.ipynb). Emojis are further sourced from [Unicode CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr), with this process being ran via the `scribe-data get -lang LANGUAGE -dt emoji-keywords` command.

# CLI Usage [`⇧`](#contents)

Scribe-Data provides a command-line interface (CLI) for efficient interaction with its language data functionality. Please see the [usage guide](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/blob/main/USAGE.md) or the [official documentation](https://scribe-data.readthedocs.io/) for detailed instructions.

### Basic Usage

To utilize the Scribe-Data CLI, you can execute variations of the following command in your terminal:

```bash
scribe-data -h  # view the cli options
scribe-data [command] [arguments]
```

### Available Commands

- `list` (`l`): Enumerate available languages, data types and their combinations.
- `get` (`g`): Retrieve data from Wikidata for specified languages and data types.
- `total` (`t`): Display the total available data for given languages and data types.
- `convert` (`c`): Transform data returned by Scribe-Data into different file formats.

# Data Contracts [`⇧`](#contents)

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) has lots of [language data](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Lexicographical_data) available, but not all of it is useful for all applications. In order to make the functionality of the Scribe-Data `get` requests as simple as possible, we made the decision to always return all data for the given languages and data types. Adding the ability to pass desired forms to the commands seemed cumbersome, and larger Scribe-Data requests should be parsing [Wikidata lexeme dumps](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/entities/) as the data source.

Scribe's solution to the get all functionality while preserving the ability to get specific forms is to allow users to filter the resulting data by contracts. The data contracts for Scribe's client applications can be found in the [data_contracts](./data_contracts/) directory. Data contracts are JSON objects where the values that are used in end applications are the keys and the resulting data identifiers based on Wikidata lexeme forms are the values. If the forms for a lexeme change, then the values would also change, but all that's needed is to update the contract for the application to function again.

Efficient client application data updates using Scribe-Data follow as such:

- New data is derived via the Scribe-Data CLI
- Contracts are written to map the data values to keys that are used in the application
- Scribe-Data is ran again to get new data in the future
- The contracts are checked to make sure that all contract values still exist within the resulting data
- The question is whether a form was added or removed from a data point such that its identifier has changed
- This is done via the following command:

```bash
scribe-data cc -cd DATA_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY  # default data path is used
```

- If the check above passes, then new data can be added to the client applications
- If the check fails, then the contract values should be updated given the directions from the CLI and then new data can be loaded
- Getting just the data that's in the client application is done via the following command:

```bash
scribe-data fd -cd DATA_CONTRACTS_DIRECTORY  # default data paths are used
```

Updating contracts shouldn't be something that Scribe-Data users should have to do often if they're using stable data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). We provide this functionality given the wiki nature of the underlying data so that the Scribe community and others can easily react to potential changes in the lexeme data.

> [!NOTE]
> You can learn more about contracts and the process around them in [DATA_CONTRACTS.md](https://github.com/scribe-org/Organization/blob/main/DATA_CONTRACTS.md).

The development environment for Scribe-Data can be installed via the following steps:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [Scribe-Data repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]

> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-Data.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-Data
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-Data repository)

2. Use [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create the local development environment within your Scribe-Data directory:

- On Unix or MacOS, run:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv  # make an environment named venv
  source venv/bin/activate # activate the environment
  ```

- On Windows (using Command Prompt), run:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```

- On Windows (using PowerShell), run:

  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
  ```

After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies and set up [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) by running:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip  # make sure that pip is at the latest version
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # install development dependencies
pip install -e .  # install the local version of Scribe-Data
pre-commit install  # install pre-commit hooks
# pre-commit run --all-files  # lint and fix common problems in the codebase
```
